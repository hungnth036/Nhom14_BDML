## 💡 Key Insights

### Most Important Feature
**Glucose Level** (29.65% importance)
- Primary predictor of diabetes
- Should be priority in medical screening

### Model Performance on Test Set
```
✓ Correctly diagnosed:     119 patients (77%)
✗ Incorrectly diagnosed:   35 patients (23%)
  - False positives: 17 (people without diabetes predicted positive)
  - False negatives: 19 (diabetic patients missed)
```

### Clinical Utility
- ✅ Good for initial screening
- ✅ High specificity (83%) - low false alarms
- ✅ Acceptable sensitivity (65%) - finds most cases
- ✅ Can be used to prioritize high-risk patients for doctor review

### Dataset
- **Size:** 768 patient records (Pima Indians Diabetes Database)
- **Features:** 8 health metrics
- **Train/Test Split:** 614/154 (80/20)
- **Class Balance:** 500 healthy, 268 diabetic

### Hyperparameter Tuning
```
Tested 7 different configurations:
- n_estimators: 100, 200, 300
